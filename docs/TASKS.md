## Mandatory Pre-Execution Rule

Before development or review, invoke or explicitly compare the task against
LOOP and inspect the upstream baseline `AGENTS.md`. If project documents
conflict, stop and report drift.

## M4 Objective

Make Ark selectable in the appropriate Widget configuration/switcher surface
and render useful small and medium Widget states from the M3 persisted
5h/Daily/Weekly/Monthly rows.

M4 owns picker/intent wiring and visible small/medium presentation only. It
must consume the app-owned snapshot and must not call Ark directly.

## Preflight Findings

1. M3 already persists stable Ark rows with `percentLeft`, `resetsAt`, and
   opaque `detailText`; M4 needs no schema or network change.
2. `ProviderChoice` currently drives all of:
   - `CodexBar Usage`;
   - `CodexBar History`;
   - `CodexBar Metric` through `CompactMetricSelectionIntent`;
   - the static switcher's supported-provider filter and buttons.
   Adding one `.ark` case therefore exposes Ark beyond the requested Usage
   small/medium surface. History has no Ark daily history, and Metric offers
   credits/cost values Ark does not provide.
3. The current `WidgetUsageRow` projection copies only id/title/percent and
   drops M3's `resetsAt` and `detailText`. `UsageBarRow` renders only title,
   percentage, and bar. S7 is required to make the M3 payload visible.
4. Small and medium row limits are Ark-unaware. Small would currently render
   all four Ark rows, risking crowding; medium also renders all four but has no
   space policy for complete quota detail plus reset text.
5. Existing large Usage and Switcher families share the same row views.
   Enabling Ark selection may also make large rendering reachable even though
   FR7 requires only small and medium behavior.

## Approved Shared Touchpoints

### S6 — Ark Widget provider choice (APPROVED)

- File: `Sources/CodexBarWidget/CodexBarWidgetProvider.swift`
- Approved edit: add `.ark`, display representation `"Ark"`,
  `.ark -> .ark`, and change `init?(provider: .ark)` from `nil` to `.ark`.
- Ark may appear in `CodexBar Usage` and the static Switcher only.
- Add intent-specific `DynamicOptionsProvider` filtering in the same file so
  History and Metric exclude `.ark` without splitting/renaming the persisted
  `ProviderChoice` enum or invalidating existing configurations.
- Risk: Medium. The enum is shared, but picker filtering contains the new
  exposure while preserving existing raw values.
- Rollback: restore `.ark -> nil`, remove the enum/display/provider arms and
  intent-specific filters.

### S7 — Ark small/medium row presentation (APPROVED)

- File: `Sources/CodexBarWidget/CodexBarWidgetViews.swift`
- Approved edit: preserve `resetsAt`/`detailText` in `WidgetUsageRow`, define
  the Ark-specific selection/presentation below, and route only Ark through
  that presentation.
- Small Usage/Switcher:
  - choose the known row with the lowest `percentLeft` (highest risk);
  - preserve stable source order on ties;
  - if no row has known usage, show the first stable Ark row as unavailable;
  - render title, percent/bar, opaque detail, and relative reset using a
    compact fallback that omits lower-priority text rather than crowding.
- Medium Usage/Switcher:
  - retain all available Ark rows in stable 5h/Daily/Weekly/Monthly order;
  - render compact title + percent/bar for every row;
  - use a horizontal-fit fallback for opaque detail and relative reset so
    provider/updated state is not displaced.
- Large behavior is not an M4 deliverable. It may continue using generic rows
  but must not receive new Ark-only layout logic.
- Do not parse `detailText`; reset display derives only from `resetsAt`.
- All generic behavior for existing providers must remain unchanged.
- Risk: Medium. This file owns shared Usage and Switcher layouts across small,
  medium, and large families.
- Rollback: remove Ark-specific projection/selection/presentation and restore
  percentage-only rows.

## Allowed Implementation Scope

Codex may:

- Inspect Widget picker/intent/view/test seams and document evidence.
- Maintain the M4 branch and governance records.
- Audit the complete M4 diff and operate the repository after Bee approval.

Claude / GLM may:

- Modify only:
  - `Sources/CodexBarWidget/CodexBarWidgetProvider.swift` (S6);
  - `Sources/CodexBarWidget/CodexBarWidgetViews.swift` (S7);
  - `Tests/CodexBarTests/CodexBarWidgetProviderTests.swift`;
  - `docs/widgets.md` if needed to keep the picker list accurate;
  - `docs/TASKS.md`;
  - `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`.
- Add focused tests for:
  - `.ark` enum/display/provider round-trip;
  - Usage/Switcher eligibility and History/Metric exclusion;
  - S18 row projection;
  - small highest-risk selection, stable ties, and unknown fallback;
  - medium four-row order;
  - no behavior change for non-Ark providers.
- Create one additive local commit and stop for Codex audit.

## Forbidden Scope

- No Widget API call to Ark.
- No Ark exposure in History, Metric, burn-down, or any new Widget kind.
- No change to Ark signing, networking, credentials, menu bar, or popover.
- No `supportsOpus=true` workaround.
- No S16 typed popover payload.
- No new snapshot schema, unrelated provider, dependency, generated-file, or
  global Widget
  architecture change.
- No push, PR, merge, release, destructive operation, or history rewrite
  without Bee approval.

## Next Task — Claude M4 S6+S7 Implementation

1. Re-read LOOP, the upstream baseline rules, this task, Entry 058, and the
   boundary map.
2. Confirm the worktree/index are clean and HEAD descends from the M4
   governance commit.
3. Implement only the approved S6/S7 policy and focused tests in the exact
   allowed files.
4. Do not parse `detailText`, change M3 schema/snapshot production, enable Ark
   in History/Metric/burn-down, or change non-Ark layout behavior.
5. Run `git diff --check` and any available focused static checks. Record
   commands honestly; local build/test/check may defer to Codex if unavailable.
6. Create one additive local commit. No amend/reset/rebase/temporary index,
   push, PR, merge, or release.

## Definition of Done — M4

M4 is Done only when:

- LOOP and baseline rules were followed.
- Bee approves the exact picker and layout policy.
- Ark is selectable only in the approved Widget surfaces.
- Small Widget shows a useful Ark usage/reset state under the approved policy.
- Medium Widget shows the four available Ark windows in stable order.
- Unknown/missing windows remain unavailable/omitted rather than zero.
- M3 `resetsAt`/`detailText` data is consumed without parsing opaque detail.
- Widget performs no Ark network call.
- Existing provider Widget behavior remains unchanged.
- Focused picker, row projection/selection, and small/medium model tests pass.
- `swift build`, relevant Widget/Ark tests, `make test`, and `make check` pass,
  or an
  environment-only blocker is reproduced and recorded.
- Codex audits the complete M4 diff and records PASS/FAIL.
- Bee approves merge or moving to M5.

## Planned Milestones After M4

- M5 — Stabilization and local release candidate.
- M6 — Optional upstream contribution review.
