# Claude multi-account and status item proposal

Status: **product and auth decision required; do not merge an implementation yet.**

Related: [#1756](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/issues/1756),
[#1268](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/issues/1268), and the bounded Claude sign-in repair in
[#1811](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/pull/1811).

## Recommendation

1. Add an opt-in, read-only `claude-swap` adapter as the first Claude subscription multi-account source.
2. Normalize its results behind a provider-neutral account snapshot before adding any status item UI.
3. Make per-account status items opt-in, replace the provider item for that provider, cap selection at four, and keep
   them mutually exclusive with Merge Icons.
4. Defer account switching. A later phase may invoke `cswap --switch-to <slot> --json` only after a separate product
   decision and explicit user action.

This solves the durable OAuth refresh problem without making CodexBar a second credential vault. It also avoids a
Claude-only status item implementation that would need to be redesigned for Codex and other providers.

## Current architecture and gap

CodexBar has three account concepts today:

- The ambient Claude OAuth credential is routed from CodexBar's cache, Claude Code's credentials file, or Claude
  Code's Keychain item. It represents one active credential. Claude Code-owned expired credentials delegate refresh
  back to the CLI; CodexBar-owned cached credentials can refresh directly.
- `ProviderTokenAccount` stores a label and one token plus optional provider metadata. It has no refresh token or
  expiry model. Claude entries therefore work for session cookies, Admin API keys, or short-lived OAuth access tokens,
  but they are not durable multi-subscription OAuth sessions.
- `TokenAccountUsageSnapshot` and `CodexAccountUsageSnapshot` separately project multi-account usage into menus.
  Status items remain provider-scoped: `StatusItemIdentity` has only `merged` and `provider`, and
  `statusItems` is keyed by `UsageProvider`.

The recently merged [#1800](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/pull/1800) scopes Claude OAuth history to the routed
Keychain identity. [#1776](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/pull/1776) prevents CLI-runtime usage refreshes from
delegating credential repair to Claude Code, while app and user-initiated repair remain available. Both changes improve
single-active-account correctness; neither discovers or displays multiple subscriptions.

The closed [#1707](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/pull/1707) should not be revived. It coupled account discovery,
credential resolution, provider routing, menu rendering, and animation across a large patch while broadening
Keychain and prompt behavior. The safer seam is a credential-free usage adapter first.

## Source options

| Option | Credential ownership | Durability | Risk | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First-party OAuth account vault | CodexBar | High | New login, refresh, storage, revocation, migration, and security surface | Defer |
| Read-only `claude-swap` adapter | `claude-swap` | High | External executable and schema dependency | **Phase 1** |
| Discover Claude Code Keychain entries | Claude Code / ambiguous | Unknown | Undocumented enumeration; prompt and identity hazards | Reject |
| Existing token accounts | CodexBar config | Low for OAuth | Access token expires without refresh metadata | Keep for current cookie/API-key uses |

As of `claude-swap` v0.15.0, `cswap --list --json` returns a versioned object with `schemaVersion: 1`, an active account
number, account slots, redaction-sensitive email labels, 5-hour and 7-day usage percentages, and reset timestamps.
Handled failures return an error object and non-zero exit. CodexBar does not need `--token-status`, credential files,
Keychain access, or raw OAuth values for the display-only phase.

## Phase 1 adapter contract

- Disabled by default. User chooses an executable path and enables “Read accounts from claude-swap.”
- Execute an argument array directly: `cswap --list --json`. Never invoke a shell.
- Require `schemaVersion == 1`; reject unknown versions and partial top-level shapes.
- Bound runtime and stdout, terminate on timeout, and retain the last successful snapshot with a stale marker.
- Parse only slot number, active state, usage status, 5-hour/7-day percentages, and reset timestamps.
- Treat email as display-only sensitive data. Never log or persist it. Respect Hide Personal Info.
- Use the source-issued numeric slot for identity (`claude-swap:<slot>`), not email or credential-derived values.
- Never read `claude-swap` storage, Claude Code storage, environment credentials, or Keychain entries.
- Never run `--switch`, `--switch-to`, `--add-account`, export, import, or purge in Phase 1.
- Isolate adapter failure from ambient Claude usage. Users without `claude-swap` see no behavior change.

The executable is an optional external dependency, not a bundled component. Preferences should show detected version,
last refresh, adapter errors, and a link to the upstream project; CodexBar should not install or update it.

## Provider-neutral account model

Introduce one projection used by menus and status items rather than teaching status item code about Claude OAuth:

```swift
struct ProviderAccountUsageSnapshot: Identifiable {
    let id: ProviderAccountIdentity
    let provider: UsageProvider
    let displayLabel: String
    let isActive: Bool
    let snapshot: UsageSnapshot?
    let error: String?
    let sourceLabel: String?
}

struct ProviderAccountIdentity: Hashable {
    let source: String
    let opaqueID: String
}
```

Adapters own identity conversion. UI receives a user alias or privacy-safe ordinal when personal information is hidden.
No provider may fill identity, plan, or usage fields using another provider's data.

Existing `TokenAccountUsageSnapshot` and `CodexAccountUsageSnapshot` can migrate behind this projection in small,
separately reviewed steps. Their credential and refresh logic stays source-specific.

## Per-account status item behavior

Proposed setting under each provider's Accounts section:

- `One provider icon` (default; current behavior)
- `Selected account icons`, with up to four account checkboxes

Selecting account icons replaces that provider's aggregate item; it does not add duplicates. Account items use a
stable `StatusItemIdentity.account(provider:source:opaqueID:)`, preserve existing provider autosave names, and open the
provider menu focused on that account. A short user alias or ordinal badge distinguishes otherwise identical provider
icons. Hide Personal Info replaces labels with `Account 1`, `Account 2`, and so on.

Merge Icons continues to mean exactly one status item. Account-icon controls are disabled while it is enabled, with a
button to turn Merge Icons off. Existing users and status item positions remain unchanged until they opt in.

The alternative proposed in the #1268 discussion is a per-account toggle that adds selected account items, leaves
unselected accounts under the provider item, and coexists with Merge Icons. That is more granular, but it creates
duplicate provider/account items, makes “Merge Icons” no longer mean one item, and multiplies autosave and recovery
states. The replacement mode above is the recommendation; if maintainers prefer the additive mode, grouping and Merge
Icons semantics must be decided before implementation.

## UI proof

The mock above shows the recommended mode and its Merge Icons conflict. It is intentionally a decision artifact, not
an implementation screenshot. The following packaged synthetic-account proof verifies the bounded current behavior:
the account action is now named “Sign in with Claude Code…” and no longer claims it will add a durable CodexBar account.
No real credential, browser session, or provider call was used.

## Required decisions

1. Approve an optional external `claude-swap` read-only dependency? **Recommend yes.**
2. Keep switching out of Phase 1? **Recommend yes; display first, switching later.**
3. Approve provider-neutral account snapshots before status item work? **Recommend yes.**
4. Approve a four-item cap and mutual exclusion with Merge Icons? **Recommend yes.**
5. Use aliases/ordinals rather than email in status item labels? **Recommend yes.**

If any answer changes, settle it before implementation because it changes storage, status item migration, or the auth
boundary.

## Implementation and validation sequence

1. Add fixtures for schema v1, error payloads, unknown versions, invalid percentages/timestamps, output limits, and
   process timeout. Use a fake executable only.
2. Add the opt-in adapter and provider-neutral projection. Verify no credential reads and no impact on ambient Claude.
3. Add settings-state and menu-model tests. Keep AppKit status item creation out of headless tests.
4. Add status item identity/migration tests, then implement account items behind the opt-in setting.
5. Run focused tests, `make check`, `make test`, packaged synthetic proof, and macOS UI proof with redacted fixtures.

No credential import, account mutation, or compatibility shim is part of this proposal.
